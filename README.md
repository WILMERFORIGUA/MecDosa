# MecDosa
Website for a mechanical vehicular Enterprise. 

Mec_Dosa is a website in process (It's missing yet connection with DB).  The languages used are  js, html5 and css3.
It has 3 pages:  INDEX, PRODUCTS AND  CONTACT.

This project was inspired by a step-brother, who is a entrepreneur in mechanical vehicular Service and doesn't have yet enough money to pay for a website.
